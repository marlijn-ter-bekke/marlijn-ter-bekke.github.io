Since September 2020, I have been writing blogs for [Donders Wonders](https://blog.donders.ru.nl/). Donders Wonders is the official blog of the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. The goal of the blog is to communicate science to a wide laymen audience. In 2020, the blog won the [NWO communication award](https://blog.donders.ru.nl/?p=12858&lang=en).

I often write about language and communication. For example, I've written blogs on the role of [sniffing during conversation](https://blog.donders.ru.nl/?p=12369&lang=en) and about the many functions that [questions can have](https://blog.donders.ru.nl/?p=12502&lang=en). I've also written about how second language pronunciation is affected by [drinking alcohol](https://blog.donders.ru.nl/?p=12941&lang=en), and about whether [masculine generic terms](https://blog.donders.ru.nl/?p=13060&lang=en) (using a form such as *he* to describe people of whatever gender) are interpreted as if they refer to men. 

However, I also really enjoy writing about topics that are less directly related to my field of expertise, such as whether [yawning cools our brain](https://blog.donders.ru.nl/?p=13143&lang=en), whether botox makes you appear [emotionless](https://blog.donders.ru.nl/?p=14037&lang=en), or about the [science of science communication](https://blog.donders.ru.nl/?p=12871&lang=en). Regardless of the topic, I always do my utmost best to make sure my blogs accurately reflect the underlying research, and to prevent making bold claims. I think an essential part of science communication is also to explain how science works, and what we can/cannot conclude from specific studies. I think this is just as important as sharing interesting findings. 

All my blogs can be read [here in Dutch](https://blog.donders.ru.nl/?author_name=marlijn-ter-bekke) and [here in English](https://blog.donders.ru.nl/?author_name=marlijn-ter-bekke&lang=en).
